    "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a concept that refers to a machine's ability to perform a task that would've previously required human intelligence. It's been around since the 1950s, and its definition has been modified over decades of research and technological advancements. \n",
    "Today, AI powers self-driving cars, laptops, chatbots like ChatGPT, and image generators. So what is it, and how does it work? The phrase AI comes from the idea that if intelligence is inherent to organic life, its existence elsewhere makes it artificial. Computer scientist Alan Turing was one of the first to explore the idea that machines could use information and logic to make decisions as people do. He coined the Turing test, which compares machine ability to human ability to see if people can detect it as artificial (convincing deepfakes are an example of AI passing the Turing test). \n",
    "Basic computing systems function because programmers code them to do specific tasks. AI, on the other hand, is only possible when computers can store information, including past commands, similar to how the human brain learns by storing skills and memories. This ability makes AI systems capable of adapting and performing new skills for tasks they weren't explicitly programmed to do. Some experts define intelligence as the ability to adapt, solve problems, plan, improvise in new situations, and learn new things. Though these systems aren't a replacement for human intelligence or social interaction, today's AI systems demonstrate some traits found in human intelligence, including learning, problem-solving, pattern-finding, perception, and even a limited spectrum of creativity and social awareness.\n",
    "Of course, an important component of human intelligence is something that AI hasn't been able to replicate yet: context. For example, Google AI lacks real-world logic and can't discern human subtleties like sarcasm and humor, as evidenced by the technology advising you to add glue to pizza sauce to help the cheese stick or use gasoline to make spaghetti spicy. These examples are lower stakes, but an AI system taking action without semantic understanding can have major consequences in the wrong situation. \n",
    "AI has a slew of possible applications, many of which are now widely available in everyday life. At the consumer level, this potential includes the newly revamped Google Search, wearables, and even vacuums. The smart speakers on your mantle with Alexa or Google voice assistant built-in are also great examples of AI. Popular AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, and Claude can be used for conversational questions or tasks, like breaking down concepts, drafting emails or project outlines, and even writing creative stories. But because AI models cannot tell fact from fiction, these chatbots tend to hallucinate or make things up -- where applicable, always verify the statements a chatbot makes with independent research, especially if you're unsure about the quality of its citations. \n",
    "A major function of AI in consumer products is personalization, whether for targeted ads or biometric security. This is why your phone can distinguish your face from someone else's when you're unlocking it with Face ID, for example -- it's learned what yours looks like by referencing billions of other people's faces and matching specific data points. \n",
    "On a bigger scale, marketing and content teams can use AI to streamline production, while developers write and execute code with it. AI can also exponentially increase the speed and efficiency of medical research.\n",

       "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a concept that refers to a machine's ability to perform a task that would've previously required human intelligence. It's been around since the 1950s, and its definition has been modified over decades of research and technological advancements. \n",
       "Today, AI powers self-driving cars, laptops, chatbots like ChatGPT, and image generators. So what is it, and how does it work? The phrase AI comes from the idea that if intelligence is inherent to organic life, its existence elsewhere makes it artificial. Computer scientist Alan Turing was one of the first to explore the idea that machines could use information and logic to make decisions as people do. He coined the Turing test, which compares machine ability to human ability to see if people can detect it as artificial (convincing deepfakes are an example of AI passing the Turing test). \n",
       "Basic computing systems function because programmers code them to do specific tasks. AI, on the other hand, is only possible when computers can store information, including past commands, similar to how the human brain learns by storing skills and memories. This ability makes AI systems capable of adapting and performing new skills for tasks they weren't explicitly programmed to do. Some experts define intelligence as the ability to adapt, solve problems, plan, improvise in new situations, and learn new things. Though these systems aren't a replacement for human intelligence or social interaction, today's AI systems demonstrate some traits found in human intelligence, including learning, problem-solving, pattern-finding, perception, and even a limited spectrum of creativity and social awareness.\n",
       "Of course, an important component of human intelligence is something that AI hasn't been able to replicate yet: context. For example, Google AI lacks real-world logic and can't discern human subtleties like sarcasm and humor, as evidenced by the technology advising you to add glue to pizza sauce to help the cheese stick or use gasoline to make spaghetti spicy. These examples are lower stakes, but an AI system taking action without semantic understanding can have major consequences in the wrong situation. \n",
       "AI has a slew of possible applications, many of which are now widely available in everyday life. At the consumer level, this potential includes the newly revamped Google Search, wearables, and even vacuums. The smart speakers on your mantle with Alexa or Google voice assistant built-in are also great examples of AI. Popular AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, and Claude can be used for conversational questions or tasks, like breaking down concepts, drafting emails or project outlines, and even writing creative stories. But because AI models cannot tell fact from fiction, these chatbots tend to hallucinate or make things up -- where applicable, always verify the statements a chatbot makes with independent research, especially if you're unsure about the quality of its citations. \n",
       "A major function of AI in consumer products is personalization, whether for targeted ads or biometric security. This is why your phone can distinguish your face from someone else's when you're unlocking it with Face ID, for example -- it's learned what yours looks like by referencing billions of other people's faces and matching specific data points. \n",
       "On a bigger scale, marketing and content teams can use AI to streamline production, while developers write and execute code with it. AI can also exponentially increase the speed and efficiency of medical research."
